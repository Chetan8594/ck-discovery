### Discovery Server - Netflix Eureka

The Spring Cloud Discovery Server is a phone book for my microservices. Each service registers itself with the service registry and tells the registry where it lives (host, port, node name) and perhaps other service-specific metadata - things that other services can use to make informed decisions about it.
